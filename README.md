### Stats

### API Usage

Snip has a dead-simple, easy to use API. It is currently in alpha, please contact me if you would like to use it.

<!-- - To get the details of a URL, make a GET request to the url + `/api`, example output:

```js
{
    id: "Qra7ecH",
    stats: {
        visits: 10
    },
    shortURL: 'http://snipit.ga/Qra7ecH',
    longURL: 'http://thisisareallylongurlifonlyitcouldbeshorter.com'
}
```

- To get an array of ALL recent URL's, make a GET request to `/api/links`, example output:

```js
[{"id":"erbpgb9","stats":{"visits":1},"shortURL":"http://snipit.ga/erbpgb9","longURL":"http://kabir.ml"},{"id":"72satt9","stats":{"visits":2295},"shortURL":"http://snipit.ga/72satt9","longURL":"http://usewing.ml"}]
``` -->
